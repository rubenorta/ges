Antevenio test project
======================

This project was made with the sole purpose of demonstrating a basic
backbone.js app with a silex backend.

In order to make it work you need:

    - Run composer.phar update to fetch the vendors
    - Generate the table provided in /sql
    - Configure your nginx or apache to serve from /web dir
    - Configure the endpoints in client.html to your own webserver.
